# Description
This program uses OOP concepts to create a GUI that calculates both the area and perimeter of a shape given its dimensions.

# Features
Allows users to choose which shape they'd like to calculate.

# How to Run
Compile `main.cs`, `shapes.cs`, `gui.cs`, and `gui.Designer.cs` using a C# compiler (preferrably Visual Studio's compiler). I specificually used `Microsoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 2.6.0.62329` with the command `csc main.cs shapes.cs gui.cs gui.Designer.cs`.
